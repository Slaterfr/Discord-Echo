        "history": "Ash was born to a Temple Guard Commander and Jedi Master known as Arcturus and his mother was a member of Alderaans Senate. Ash first displayed a connection to the force when he was 3 years old. He loved to watch his father spar with other members of the Order, his father was an exceptional fighter, and Ash was often mesmerized by his glowing yellow double-bladed saber.\n\nAsh often trained with his father, becoming extremely proficient at saber combat, and he aspired to become a Temple Guard like him. But one day when Ash was training he heard fighting not far from where he was, it was coming from the guard Dojo, where his father was often posted.\n\nAsh ran over and saw a single assailant fighting 10 Temple Guards at once, the assailant wielded dual sabers and fought flawlessly, Ash had never seen anything like it. They defeated all 10 Temple Guards, rendering each incapable of fighting without killing any of them.\n\nAsh saw his father walking toward the assailant, they said something to each other, but Ash couldn't hear it. Ash had never seen his father ever lose a fight, to him he was unbeatable, but for the first time ever, Ash feared his father would lose. Ash's father and the assailant engaged in combat.\n\nThe two were evenly matched, both fought so much harder than they had before, Ash tried to get closer to help but as soon as he got near the assailant pushed Ash away. But Ash was much closer now, and he saw his father's eyes, they were yellow and filled with rage, but his father's eyes were blue before. The way both fighters fought, it was like they transformed into something completely different then before.\n\nAsh had never seen his father fight so aggressively before, with such intent to kill, with such hate. For a moment Ash's father gained the upper hand, pinning the assailant onto the ground, her hood came off, revealing the assailant to be Swift, an exiled Jedi Councilor and former Chief General who was thought to be dead for the past 25 years.\n\nBut Swift gave a kick straight to Arcturus's left ankle, knocking him down, then she sliced his saber causing half of it to be disabled, just then Swift went in for the killing blow. But Ash stopped him now within range, he blocked the hit with his saber allowing his father a chance to get back on his feet. But in the next moment the assailant disarmed Ash as well and once again pushed him far back, even farther this time.\n\nSwift and Arcturus continued to fight with their full strength, pure force leaking from them, the presence of the force was visible around the two of them. Each strike imbued with the force, such power that Ash had never seen before. Each hit exchanged produced shockwaves throughout the temple, a sort of barrier was around the room, making it so all the Jedi could do was watch. And finally, the two of them went in for one last swing, the energy around them hitting its climax, and as their sabers clashed, a massive shockwave went out causing an explosion, smoke filled the room, and both fighters disappeared. It was thought that the explosion disintegrated both of them, although no one really knew what happened.\n\n2 Years had now passed since his father died, Ash was now a Jedi Knight and had become friends with many people in the Order among these people were Cev and Ttv. Ttv and Ash often saw each other as both we're usually assigned to Coruscant, although Cev was assigned to Dantooine as part of the Temple Guards. Ash received word that he was asked to take part in an investigation on Dantooine, investigating the murder of 3 Jedi Masters one of which was the Leader of TG.\n\nAsh, Cev and Ttv were often together throughout the investigation, one member or the investigation, Zukito went to pursue a lead, he told Ash that if he wasn't back by nightfall that something had gone wrong. That was all he told Ash, so when Zukito didn't return, him, Ttv and Cev went out to investigate, all they found was Zukito's blood, and a lot of it, no sign of his body though.\n\nThey had a list of around 20 suspects with no real clues as to who it could really be and no hope of narrowing it down yet. Until the entire investigation team was awoken in the middle of the night, Ttv had overheard 3 people talking about a plot to kill Tae next, he identified 2 of them but could not figure out the third. One of them was a member of the investigation team, Slid, and the other was Blue, both of them were TG captains. They arrested them and put them in the Dantooine holding cells, but the investigation wasn't over till they got the third.\n\nThe senior members of the investigation squad all tried interrogating the 2, but they had no success. So Cev, Ash and Ttv volunteered to give it another shot and try to figure it out. Arkomes, who was a TG Captain and Cev's Master, volunteered to go with them and oversee it. But when they got to the cell block, Ash sensed something was off, and they soon saw blood everywhere, the guards and Blue were dead, although no sign of Slid. Ash quickly tested the blood in the room, some of it was Slids and there was some more blood that couldn't be identified immediately. So, they took it back and went to test it.\n\nAsh gave the blood to a medical droid and then they went to get lunch while Arkomes went to update the rest of the team. But when they returned to figure out the blood results, the droid was smashed and the blood was gone. Arkomes told Cev, Ttv and Ash that they should go with him to the courtyard so they could discuss case details so far. But Ttv said he had to go tell Mule and Tae about what happened while they did that.\n\nAfter they got to the courtyard Arkomes asked Ash, \"So what do we know so far?\", Ash answered \"Well after everything that's happened so far, I think it's only safe to assume the third member must be a TG Captain as well. Someone who would benefit from the death of the JMs and of Tae. I don't think Zukito was ever an intended casualty, but he just got to close to figuring it out. I normally would say Slid escaped with the third member, but due to the fact that Blue is dead and we found Slids blood, I think it's safe to assume that Slid fought back and injured them before running away.\" Arkomes and Cev agreed and they continued talking about it.\n\nTtv showed up and Cev began to catch him up on everything they had discussed, but Ttv interrupted him \"About that, I was talking to Mule and Tae, and they said that you never told them about the prison, matter of fact, they said they never even saw you after we went to interrogate Blue and Slid, yet you clearly told us thats what you were doing when the blood was stolen Arkomes. You were that third person that night, weren't you? You killed Zukito, you killed those Masters, and you killed Blue, you even tried to kill Slid, but he injured you in that prison, didn't he?? and you were going to kill Tae and blame it all on Ash, weren't you??? And I bet we'll find that injury Cev was talking about after we arrest you too.\" Ttv had now ignited his saber and was pointing it at Arkomes.\n\nArkomes looked surprised at first and Cev and Ash also were taken completely off guard. Everyone waited for Arkomes to respond. Ash first didn't believe it, but when he put Arkomes into the equation and what Ttv had said, it all made sense. Cev likely came to the same realization at that moment. When Arkomes saw they knew it was him, he gave a slight grin and then said, \"Well I'm impressed you were able to figure all that out, a shame you'll never live to tell anyone.\" Arkomes quickly crushed all 3 of their Sabers using the force and then ignited his own. He had them cornered, and just as he went for the killing blow, a purple saber ignited through his chest, his eyes widened and he drew his last breath, before falling to the ground and dying. When he fell, they saw Zukito standing behind him, extremely injured and bloody, but still alive, he had saved them from certain death. They took Zukito back to the Temple and he received proper treatment, the investigation was closed with Blue, Slid and Arkomes officially listed as the perpetrators, although Slid had escaped Dantooine after his fight with Arkomes in the prison.\n\nAll of them returned to the Temple and Ash got to watch Ttv and Cev be inducted as Knights of the order. Ash spoke to his superiors in TG, and they all agreed that Cev was due for a promotion after the way he handled the Conspiracy, but Cev turned it down and joined the Taskforce. However, Ash was promoted in TG to the rank of Warden after the Conspiracy.\n\nA few years had now passed, Ash Cev and Ttv were all now Instructors and among the top prospects in their respective divisions. Ash had two padawans during this time, Kuhki and Blox. Ash imparted all the wisdom and combat skill he could into them. Blox was already showing an extreme proficiency in combat and was almost at Ash's level of combat.\n\nOne day Ash received an emergency notification requiring him to head to the Council Chambers. When he arrived, he noticed there were already multiple Jedi in the Chambers. The Jedi in the chambers were as follows, Ttv, Cev, Blox, Kuhki, and the only ones he didn't personally know were Adams and Forsaken 2 High Councilors and very high-ranking division members, and then Slater an old Taskforce General and owner of Slater Industries, he had only ever heard rumors about them.\n\nThey were briefed on a mission known as Operation Peacewalker. Adams would be taking point on the operation. They had to find a target and subdue Swift, who they discovered was still alive, they were not allowed to tell anyone Swift was still alive yet, this was extremely new information and extremely classified. Forsaken was the only one in the room who would not be taking part in the mission, his job was to make sure everything went smoothly from the confines of Coruscant.\n\nThe Council had been monitoring all activity in the Sector where Swift was last seen, and they were sure she was still there. So, the Jedi boarded their ship and set a course for the sector. Upon arriving they instantly began their investigation, and the clues were leading them to one place, Pillio, the once home world of the Eternal Empire, but has long since been abandoned, or so the Jedi thought.\n\nWhen they entered the planet's atmosphere immediately the ship scanners began to go off. Suddenly an old Eternal Empire fighter appeared behind them, Slater immediately ran to the bridge to try and take control of the auto pilot, but before he could, it fired on them, instantly destroying the ships engines. They had to land and fast, but the terrain was dangerous where they were, so Slater took control of the ship and was able to steer it through the mountains till they passed them, then came the hardest part, landing. Slater crash landed the ship on Pillios surface, and everyone was safe.\n\nAfter going over their options, the team decided to venture towards an old Eternal Empire base, there they could maybe find something that would let them call for help. So, they began walking, upon arriving they located an old comms system; after working together they figured out a way to get it on. The receiver was broken however so they could only send messages out and hope for the best, no way of knowing if it would be heard or not.\n\nThey sent a transmission out for help and hoped for the best. Ash and Adams began to discuss plans on what they should do, but then Ttv called out to them all. Everyone came to see what it was about, and he pointed out something, a dust trail in the distance, getting closer, someone was coming for them. They quickly realized it was far to soon for any reinforcements from the Order, so it had to be hostiles. The team quickly geared for combat and waited for them to come."

        "history": "Ceviche was born on Dantooine, he began displaying a connection to the force at a young age, and he was brought to the temple on Dantooine by a Temple Guard named Arkomes.\n\nCev trained on Dantooine until the time finally came for him to be a Padawan, before a Master could be selected, he was sent to Coruscant to present himself before the Council. The Council communed with him and then said they would meditate and then reconvene on who his Master would be. While on Coruscant he met many new members of the order, including Ttv and Ash, Ttv was a Padawan who was a member of Taskforce while Ash was a Temple Guard who had already been knighted.\n\nThe 3 of them were Talking when Ttv received a message asking him to go to the Taskforce Dojo, a new General was supposed to be selected. Ash and Cev joined him at the Dojo as they had nothing else to do, the one conducting the General Induction was Ttv's Master and a Jedi Councilor who was known as Mule.\n\nA Jedi Instructor and Marshal named Zukito was selected to be the next General. To their surprise he was the same age as them, yet he had already risen to such a high spot in Taskforce and the Order. Right after the ceremony Mule pulled Cev aside and told him that Arkomes would be his Master.\n\nCev accompanied Arkomes back to their post on Dantooine, Cev joined the Jedi Temple Guards through an apprenticeship program. Cev learned a great many things about combat during this time, then a few years later, in the middle of the night a Master was murdered. And the next night another Master, and the night after that the leader of the Temple Guards who had been sent to Dantooine, Killer Aureus, was also murdered. Someone was targeting Masters who were on Dantooine.\n\nCev was informed that multiple Jedi from Coruscant would be sent to assist in the investigation. Cev was quite pleased when he learned who was coming; Ttv, who was still a Padawan as well and climbing his way up in Taskforce, Ash who was now a Vanguard in the Temple Guards, Slid Inquisitorius, a Jedi Instructor and head of the Inquisitorius bloodline and a Temple Guard Captain, 'Westside' Tae a Master and a Temple Guard Captain, and the overseer of the investigation, Zukito a Jedi Instructor and General, and finally, Mule a Jedi Councilor, Taskforce General, and Ttv's Master.\n\nCev, Arkomes, and a few other officials were coordinating directly with Mule's team to try and figure out who was behind these murders. They began to interview everyone, but there was one major problem, because of how late it was, almost no one was together, so only about 20 of the many Jedi on Dantooine actually had alibis. The possible suspects were numerous, so they had to investigate who could benefit, or who had motive. Many people could benefit from the deaths however, whenever someone high up dies, it usually means someone will move to fill that gap, and then someone else fills the gap that they leave behind. One thing was sure, this investigation would not be easy.\n\nBut after some diligent work, they came up with a list of the 20 most likely suspects, Cev and Arkomes were among them, because Arkomes as a Master and Captain would benefit from an open Leader spot in TG and less Master competition, and Cev because Arkomes was his teacher. Zukito separated from the group to chase some leads he got. But after it became night, Ttv, Ash, and Cev began to worry, so they went looking for him, but when they got to where he was supposed to be, all they found was blood, Zukitos blood. It seemed whoever Zukito was following, was the killer, and they got him. But Zukito never told them which leads he was pursuing, so they were no closer.\n\nThe next night came and everyone was resting, but suddenly they were all woken up by Ttv, he had overheard 3 people talking, one of them was Slid, and the other Blue, Blue was among the suspects list but Slid wasn't even considered as he was on coruscant during the first 3 killings, Ttv overheard a conspiracy to kill Tae next, they heard him when he was sneaking away and tried to chase him.\n\nTtv managed to escape them, and he warned Mule, Tae and the rest of the team about what he heard, he even managed to record it, they arrested Slid and Blue and put them in the Dantooine holding cells, but they still didn't know who the third member of the conspiracy was.\n\nSo, the investigation continued, they now were certain the third member must be part of the Temple Guards, this narrowed their suspect list to only about 10 more people. All of the senior members of the investigation had tried to interrogate Slid and Blue to find out who the third member was, but they weren't giving any info up. So, Cev Ttv and Ash all volunteered to give it one last shot at interrogating them, and Arkomes agreed to come with to oversee the interrogation. But as soon as they got near the holding cells they could sense something was off, they each ignited their sabers and slowly approached. As soon as they reached them, they saw blood everywhere, the on-duty guards were dead, as was Blue, but Slids body could not be found, although there was blood from Slid and one other person, thought to be the assailant.\n\nSo, the 3 of them went to go test the blood to try and get a match and finally end the investigation while Arkomes went to inform Mule and Tae. Ash and Ttv went to get lunch with Cev while they waited for the results back on the blood. But when they returned the sample was gone, and the droid who was testing it was smashed. Ash and Cev went to meet up with Arkomes to talk to him about the investigation, while Ttv went to tell Mule and Tae about what happened.\n\nCev's group began to go over details, and then Ttv showed up, Cev began to catch him up on what they had concocted so far \"We believe the assailant is most likely another TG Captain, we think he fought with Slid but Slid escaped with his life after injuring the assailant, but we still don't know which suspect it could be. Arkomes seems cleared now as he was with Mule when the blood was stolen.\" He was about to continue when Ttv interrupted him \"About that, I was talking to Mule and Tae, and they said that you never told them about the prison, matter of fact, they said they never even saw you after we went to interrogate Blue and Slid, yet you clearly told us thats what you were doing when the blood was stolen Arkomes. You were that third person that night, weren't you? You killed Zukito, you killed those Masters, and you killed Blue, you even tried to kill Slid, but he injured you in that prison, didn't he?? and you were going to kill Tae and blame it all on Ash, weren't you??? And I bet we'll find that injury Cev was talking about after we arrest you too.\"\n\nArkomes looked surprised at first and Cev and Ash also looked completely taken off guard. Everyone waiting for Arkomes to respond, but Ttv ignited his saber. When Arkomes saw they knew it was him, he gave a slight grin and then said \"Well I'm impressed you were able to figure all that out, a shame you'll never live to tell anyone.\" Arkomes quickly crushed all 3 of their Sabers using the force, and then ignited his own. He had them cornered, and just as he went for the killing blow, a purple saber ignited through his chest, his eyes widened and he drew his last breath, before falling to the ground and dying. When he fell, they saw Zukito standing behind him, extremely injured and bloody, but still alive, he had saved them from certain death. They took Zukito back to the Temple and he received proper treatment, the investigation was closed with Blue, Slid and Arkomes officially listed as the perpetrators, although Slid had escaped Dantooine after his fight with Arkomes in the prison.\n\nCev was called to return to Coruscant with the rest of the investigation team, both Cev and Ttv were knighted then, and Cev was offered a higher position in the Temple Guards, but after everything that happened on Dantooine, he decided it would be best if he joined the Jedi Taskforce. So Cev left the Temple Guards and was inducted into Taskforce that day as well."

        "history": "Ttv has quite the unusual origin, during a Crystal Gathering expedition to Ilum, while a Master was reciting the Jedi Code, they heard a baby crying, but Ilum had not been home to anyone for a long time. But Ttv was there, an infant boy, with no one else that the Jedi could sense on the planet, it was as if he just appeared there. If the expedition was even a day later, he likely would have frozen to death.\n\nThe Jedi who had found Ttv on Ilum was known as Knight MJacobH, the Jedi in charge cancelled the Gathering and brought Ttv back to Coruscant, there Ttv was tested by Councilor Hynxz. Despite being in the cold alone for at least a day, his vitals were fine, and the most surprising part, his Midi-chlorian count was higher than anything Hynxz had ever seen, reaching nearly 17,000.\n\nTtv had MJacobH as his first teacher, but shortly after, MJ was found out to be in violation of Jedi Conduct, and his knighthood was revoked and he was expelled from the Order. So, the Council Made Hynxz be Ttv's next Master. Hynxz was an extremely wise Jedi, but in combat he didn't excel, and he was so busy that he could never make time for Ttv. So, Hynxz suggested that the Council give Ttv Mule as a Master, Mule was leader of the Jedi Taskforce and could give Ttv a proper apprenticeship that his previous Masters couldn't.\n\nMule taught Ttv many things, discipline, combat, and most of all, a deep connection to the force and the importance of life. Ttv learned how to best use his force and stamina from Mule's old Master Ken Corleone or just 'Kenny'. Because Ttv's Master was the Leader of the Jedi Taskforce, it just made sense that Ttv was inducted into the Taskforce.\n\n2 Years had now passed since Ttv became a Padawan, Ttv had been searching for a place to belong, a family or bloodline so to speak, he had joined many, but none were ever the right fit and none kept him long. Ttv made many friends in the Galaxy throughout these 2 years, 2 of which were Ash and Cev, both Temple Guards he had met soon after he came to Coruscant. Ttv received word from Mule that he was to take part in an investigation on Dantooine, investigating the murder of 3 Jedi Masters one of which was the Leader of TG.\n\nFinally, Ttv saw a chance to prove himself to everyone that had been doubting him these past few years and finally get himself a group of people that he could truly call his family. Among the investigation team sent to Dantooine were three members of Taskforce, Mule who was head of the Investigation and Chief general, Zukito who was a General, and then Ttv. There were also 2 members of TG among the investigators, Ash who was Ttvs friend, and then Tae and Slid who were both TG Captains.\n\nCev and Arkomes who was Cev's master and a TG Captain, were coordinating directly with Mule's team to try and figure out who was behind these murders. They began to interview everyone, but there was one major problem, because of how late it was when the killings happened, almost no one was together, so only about 20 of the many Jedi on Dantooine actually had alibis. The possible suspects were numerous, so they had to investigate who could benefit, or who had motive. Many people could benefit from the deaths however, whenever someone high up dies, it usually means someone will move to fill that gap, and then someone else fills the gap that they leave behind.

It seemed whoever Zukito was following, was the killer, and they got him. But Zukito never told them which leads he was pursuing, so they were no closer.\n\nThe next night came and the entire investigation team was resting, but Ttv couldn't sleep, so he began to walk around the Temple, but soon he overheard talking, it was coming from the TG courtyard, it was Slid, Blue and someone else 3 TG Captains, he could tell by their insignia on their arm, all talking. Slid was talking about how they were planning on killing Tae next, to increase their chances of rising up through TG, and then framing it on Ash. Ttv overheard everything, and just as he started sneaking away, he stepped in a puddle of water, suddenly all three stopped talking, and their heads all turned in his direction. He began to run away as they chased him, they were catching up on him, and he knew he had to act fast. So right as he turned a corner, he used the force to jump up to the roof and held himself up there off a lantern. The 3 turned the corner and ran right past him. He jumped down after they had got far enough away, and he ran to warn Tae and Mule.\n\nTtv safely got to the place where the investigation team was resting and he warned Mule, Tae and the rest of the team about what he heard, he even managed to record it, they arrested Slid and Blue and put them in the Dantooine holding cells, but they still didn't know who the third member of the conspiracy was.\n\nSo, the investigation continued, they now were certain the third member must be part of the Temple Guards, this narrowed their suspect list to only about 10 more people.

Arkomes asked Cev Ttv and Ash to come with him to the courtyard so they could discuss details about the case. But Ttv needed to talk to his Master, and could sense something was off, so he declined and lied, saying that Mule had planned something with him.\n\nWhen Ttv got to where Mule and Tae were, he told them \"The blood got stolen, Ark, Ash and Cev are talking in the courtyard right now, but I wanted to talk to both of you, please tell me you have some sort of info.\" Mule quickly spoke up \"Uh, what blood?\" Ttv responded \"What do you mean what blood, didn't Arkomes tell you about what happened in the prison??\" Mule went to talk again but Tae interjected \"Prison, what happened in the prison? We haven't seen Arkomes since you 3 went with him to interrogate Blue and Slid.\"\n\nTtv quickly realized the third member was Arkomes and that Slid was probably trying to escape as they spoke. So, he quickly said, \"I figured it out, I know who the third member is, but more importantly, you two need to find slid, he escaped from the prison, I'll explain it all later, just hurry and find him!\" Ttv ran off to the courtyard as Mule and Tae were stunned for a moment in shock, and then they quickly moved to try and find Slid.\n\nTtv rushed to the courtyard and when he arrived Cev began to catch him up on what they had concocted so far \"We believe the assailant is most likely another TG Captain, we think he fought with Slid but Slid escaped with his life after injuring the assailant, but we still don't know which suspect it could be. Arkomes seems cleared now as he was with Mule when the blood was stolen.\" He was about to continue when Ttv interrupted him \"About that, I was talking to Mule and Tae, and they said that you never told them about the prison, matter of fact, they said they never even saw you after we went to interrogate Blue and Slid, yet you clearly told us thats what you were doing when the blood was stolen Arkomes.

And I bet we'll find that injury Cev was talking about after we arrest you too.\"\n\nArkomes looked surprised at first and Cev and Ash also looked completely taken off guard. Everyone waiting for Arkomes to respond, but Ttv ignited his saber. After a moment of thinking Cev and Ash both realized Ttv was right and the shock disappeared from their faces. When Arkomes saw they knew it was him, he gave a slight grin and then said, \"Well I'm impressed you were able to figure all that out, a shame you'll never live to tell anyone.\" Arkomes quickly crushed all 3 of their Sabers using the force and then ignited his own. He had them cornered, and just as he went for the killing blow, a purple saber ignited through his chest, his eyes widened and he drew his last breath, before falling to the ground and dying. When he fell, they saw Zukito standing behind him, extremely injured and bloody, but still alive, he had saved them from certain death. They took Zukito back to the Temple and he received proper treatment, the investigation was closed with Blue, Slid and Arkomes officially listed as the perpetrators, although Slid had escaped Dantooine after his fight with Arkomes in the prison.\n\nTtv and Cev were both inducted as Knights of the Order by Mule back on Coruscant. Ttv managed to get Cev to leave the Temple Guards behind and join the Taskforce."
